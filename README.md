# random_run
run a command with randomized list of arguments (C++17)

read the manpage for details

Basically, this is a toy project to learn some features of C++17. Code is slightly over board,
especially the conversion from argv into a vector of string.

It's still useful, I have some large collections of files that I occasionally want to peruse
(videos / music) in a random order, but the tools I use are not too good for that.

For instance, mpv shuffle will replay the same file several times.

Occasionally, I also want to filter files, e.g., exclude pdf files from mpv perview.
